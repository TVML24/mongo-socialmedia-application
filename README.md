## Description

The motivation behind this project was to practice and clarify concepts and understanding related to the use of mongoDB and Mongoose to create a functional backend for a social media website. It involved involved significant learning around the MVC model, relationships in MongoDB, getters, virtuals and other important features. The application's structure and pseudocoding were not so difficult, but the exact routes and queries required took a bit of work. Finally, working with dayJS and other libraries was required.

## Installation

Run NPM install prior to use.
Use NPM start to start the server.

## Usage

After the user has used the command npm start from the integrated terminal the server will start. 
From this point the user can make Get, Post, Put, and Delete calls to the database concerning categories/products or tags by using the appropriate route using Insomnia.
e.g. Localhost:3001/Categories/3.
When a valid request is made using JSON the application will update the database.

## Credits

This project makes use of code from the bootcamp activities - although modified for this purpose.

The idea for the email validation came from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18022365/mongoose-validate-email-syntax.

It also makes use of nodeJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, ExpressJs, DayJS and others.

The rest is my own work.

Credit also to my teachers, as without them this would not have been possible.
